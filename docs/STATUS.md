**Public build:** original code only; no vendor binaries, LUTs or calibration assets.

## Verified on device

| Feature | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Camera2 NDK preview | Camera 0 opens; preview active |
| Preview restart latency | ~50 ms after the `onReady` fix |
| 12 MP JPEG | 4096×3072, ~1.3 MB, EXIF orientation |
| RAW 12 → DNG | 4096×3072, ~25 MB, DNG 1.4, 16-bit |
| RAW 50 → DNG | 8192×6144, 96 MB, DNG 1.4, 16-bit |
| HDR 3× | 3 YUV frames → fused JPEG 3072×4096 |
| HDR on ultra-wide / tele | works |
| Lens 0.6× / 1× / 3× | camera IDs 3 / 0 / 4 |
| Mode/lens restart | same Surface, preview resumes |
| HAL fallback | unsupported mode falls back to 12 MP JPEG |
| CI | public GitHub Actions green |
| Release workflow | `v0.3.0-alpha.1` APK + SHA-256 published |

## Implemented but not fully validated

- HDR quality on textured static scenes and moving subjects.
- DNG color: public build uses a generic sRGB D65 matrix; per-sensor calibration
  is not bundled.
- 50 MP DNG color/black-level accuracy in Lightroom/Photoshop.
- Thermal behavior for repeated HDR / RAW 50 captures.

## Known limitations

| Issue | Detail |
|---|---|
| 50 MP JPEG unavailable | HAL returns 1920×1440 even for an 8192×6144 reader; engine rejects it via JPEG SOF check. Use RAW 50. |
| DNG color uncalibrated | Generic sRGB matrix; user-supplied ColorMatrix/black/white levels needed. |
| HDR alignment | Translation-only NCC; rotation/parallax/moving subjects can ghost. |
| No Live Photo yet | Motion Photo container exists; video/audio ring buffer not implemented. |
| No video recording yet | 4K 4:3 / 16:9, stereo audio and stabilization are next. |
| Alpha signing | APKs are debug-signed. |
| Package identity | Requires uninstalling the old patched clone `com.oneplus.camera`. |
| No gallery integration | Photos are in app-specific external storage. |

## Current focus

1. DNG calibration workflow (user-supplied profiles).
2. HDR quality comparison and tuning.
3. Live Photo 6 s / stereo audio.
4. 4K 4:3 video.
5. UI/gallery polish.

## Notes

- The stock camera `com.oplus.camera` remains enabled.
- The old private research repo is not part of the public build.
- Host test count in the public build: 29 (vendor-specific LUT/tone modules are not
  included).
